# Crypto Clustering
## Repository Structure:
In this repository, the main file will be "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb" with the .csv file sitting tight in the "Resources" folder.

In this class assignment I've used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning (specifically K-means clustering as well as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on clustering) to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
